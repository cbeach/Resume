\section{EXPERIENCE}
    {\sl \textbf{Computer Science Tutor}} \hfill \textbf{2011-Present} \\
    College of Computer Science, Portland State University \hfill

    Mentor freshmen, sophomore, and junior students.  Teaching them basic and intermediate 
    computer science principles and techniques.	I've hosted several introductory workshops 
    on using Linux, and basic Python.

    {\sl \textbf{Supportland.com}} \hfill \textbf{2011-Present} \\
    College of Computer Science Capstone, Portland State University \hfill

    Myself and my fellow team mates were responsible for writing a wordpress plugin 
    for supportland.com.  My responsibilities included system administration, as 
    well as coding.  During the duration of this project I have learned a great
    deal about PHP, javascript, and web development as a whole.

    {\sl \textbf{Twitter Streaming API Cache Project Lead}} \hfill \textbf{2012-Present} \\
    College of Computer Science, Portland State University \\
    Github.com/cbeach/twitter\_vamp 

    I am working on a server that will passively collect public status updates from the
    Twitter streaming api.  These status updates will be stored so that other PSU student
    and myself may do natural langauge processing, semantic analysis, and datamining on
    a very large dataset.				

    {\sl \textbf{3D Printing and Advanced Fabrication}} \hfill \textbf{2010-2012} \\
    Open Tech-Lab, Portland State University

    I have completed an open source RepRap 3D printer. The printer started as a solo project, 
    but since the completion of the initial build a team has been found to assist with further 
    upgrades and research.  I built the RepRap from scratch.  I fabricated the structure, soldered  
    the electronics, and flashed the firmware. 	The goals of this project are to advance the 
    fields of robotic manufacturing and replication, to assist other projects at PSU, and to 
    provide a teaching platform for students to learn more about rapid prototyping. 
    More information can be found at http://projects.cecs.pdx.edu/projects/opentech-reprap.
