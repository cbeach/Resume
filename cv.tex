                    Feedback Innovations is a company that collects customer satisfaction data after an ambulance ride.  Their original site was written in such a way that it was not extensible.  Another developer was hired through a third party to re-write the entire site.  The original developer disappeared, leaving the site in a very poor state.
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] Advised Jon Hance (project manager) and Joe Stepp (developer) on refactoring and estimates
                        \item[\textbullet] Optimized report generation.  Large reports no longer crashes the server.

                    A game description language (GDL) is a computer language that describes the rules of a game.  
                    This project was inspired by my interest in general game playing, and spurred on by the 
                    Stanford general game playing online class.  The LeisurelyScript language draws inspiration 
                    from Python and the language outlined in Cameron Browne's "Automatic Generation and Evaluation".  
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] LeisurelyScript uses Flex and Bison to generate the scanner and parser
                        \item[\textbullet] The parser is used for the generation of a state machine expressed in C++
                        \item[\textbullet] The C++ state machine is then compiled into dll's using g++ and maximum optimization
                        \item[\textbullet] The state machine implements a standard API that and AI can query for required information

                    \textbf{Bitcoin Data Collection} \hfill \textbf{December 2013-February 2014} \\
                    This project utilizes Storm to collect streams of data from several bitcoin exchanges.  This 
                    project's purpose was to gain experience with data collection and analysis tools.  Utilizes 
                    Storm an open source framework for "Distributed and fault-tolerant realtime computation"
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] Storm uses a graph like abstraction for representing the flow of data through various analyses
                        \item[\textbullet] Each node in Storm's graph is an algorithm, each directed edge represents algorithmic input/output
                        \item[\textbullet] Storm is language agnostic,  nodes (aka spouts and bolts) were written in Python due familiarity.
                        \item[\textbullet] Spouts (nodes that insert data into the graph) were written for Twitter, Mt. Gox, Btc-e, CoinBase, etc.
                        \item[\textbullet] An analysis tool (bolt) was written to analyze when there was an opportunity for arbitrage.

                    well as coding.  During the duration of this project I have learned a great
                    deal about PHP, javascript, and web development as a whole.

                    Twitter streaming api.  These status updates will be stored so that other PSU student
                    and myself may do natural langauge processing, semantic analysis, and datamining on
                    a very large dataset.

                    I have completed an open source RepRap 3D printer. The printer started as a solo project, 
                    but since the completion of the initial build a team has been found to assist with further 
                    upgrades and research.  I built the RepRap from scratch.  I fabricated the structure, soldered  
                    the electronics, and flashed the firmware. 	The goals of this project are to advance the 
                    fields of robotic manufacturing and replication, to assist other projects at PSU, and to 
                    provide a teaching platform for students to learn more about rapid prototyping.
