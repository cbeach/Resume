                    A game description language (GDL) is a computer language that describes the rules of a game. 
                    This project was inspired by my interest in machine learning and AI. It has been spurred on by the 
                    Stanford general game playing MOOC. The ultimate goal is to explore the properties that make a game
                    fun, which can be used for the evaluation of new games produced using genetic programming techniques. 
                    The LeisurelyScript language draws heavily from the language 
                    outlined in Cameron Browne's "Automatic Generation and Evaluation".
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] LeisurelyScript uses Scala compiler macros to parse my extension to the language 
                        \item[\textbullet] The compiler is used for the generation of a state machine expressed in Scala 
                        \item[\textbullet] The state machine implements a standard API that an AI can query for required information
                        \item[\textbullet] The state machine will then be fed into a WIP evaluation and genetic prgramming framework
                        \item[\textbullet] The end goal of this is to produce a ML ecosystem that is capable of randomly generating game rules

                    Myself and my fellow team mates were responsible for writing a wordpress plugin 
                    for supportland.com. My responsibilities included system administration, as 
                    well as coding. During the duration of this project I have learned a great
                    deal about PHP, javascript, and web development as a whole.

                    I am working on a server that will passively collect public status updates from the
                    Twitter streaming api. These status updates will be stored so that other PSU student
                    and myself may do natural langauge processing, semantic analysis, and datamining on
                    a very large dataset.

                    I have completed an open source RepRap 3D printer. The printer started as a solo project, 
                    but since the completion of the initial build a team has been found to assist with further 
                    upgrades and research. I built the RepRap from scratch. I fabricated the structure, soldered  
                    the electronics, and flashed the firmware. 	The goals of this project are to advance the 
                    fields of robotic manufacturing and replication, to assist other projects at PSU, and to 
                    provide a teaching platform for students to learn more about rapid prototyping.
