\section{SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS} 
    I have lead several projects and participated in many others. In my personal life, my projects are 
    chosen based on marketability and difficulty. My preference is for massive, difficult projects have 
    a great deal of utility and or marketability. These most often involve some form of data 
    collection/analysis or cutting edge AI.
    
    My professional experience has included a wide range of technologies and solutions.  These range from
    telecommunication, e-commerce, and data analysis. I was recently given the title of lead developer and 
    given the opportunity to mentor a recent college graduate.
    
    I am currently actively pursuing projects in big data, machine learning, and AI.  Below is a short 
    list of my expertise and interests.  

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data analysis and collection, particularly Twitter's streaming API and BitCoin market data
        \item Researching novel ways to visualize and encode data for easy human consumption

                    A game description language (GDL) is a computer language that describes the rules of a game. 
                    This project was inspired by my interest in machine learning and AI. It has been spurred on by the 
                    Stanford general game playing MOOC. The ultimate goal is to explore the properties that make a game
                    fun for use in evaluation of new games produced using genetic programming techniques. 
                    The LeisurelyScript language draws heavily from the language 
                    outlined in Cameron Browne's "Automatic Generation and Evaluation".
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] LeisurelyScript uses Flex and Bison to generate the scanner and parser
                        \item[\textbullet] The compiler is used for the generation of a state machine expressed in C++
                        \item[\textbullet] The C++ state machine is then compiled into dll's using g++
                        \item[\textbullet] The state machine implements a standard API that an AI can query for required information

                    Myself and my fellow team mates were responsible for writing a wordpress plugin 
                    for supportland.com. My responsibilities included system administration, as 
                    well as coding. During the duration of this project I have learned a great
                    deal about PHP, javascript, and web development as a whole.

                    Twitter streaming api. These status updates will be stored so that other PSU student
                    and myself may do natural langauge processing, semantic analysis, and datamining on
                    a very large dataset.

                    Open Tech-Lab, Portland State University

                    I have completed an open source RepRap 3D printer. The printer started as a solo project, 
                    but since the completion of the initial build a team has been found to assist with further 
                    upgrades and research. I built the RepRap from scratch. I fabricated the structure, soldered  
                    the electronics, and flashed the firmware. 	The goals of this project are to advance the 
                    fields of robotic manufacturing and replication, to assist other projects at PSU, and to 
                    provide a teaching platform for students to learn more about rapid prototyping.
