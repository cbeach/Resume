\section{SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS} 
    I have lead several projects and participated in many others. In my personal life, my projects are 
    chosen based on marketability and difficulty. My preference is for massive, difficult projects have 
    a great deal of utility. These most often involve some form of data 
    collection/analysis or cutting edge AI.
    
    I am currently actively pursuing projects in big data, machine learning, and AI.  Below is a short 
    list of my expertise and interests.  

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Data analysis and collection, particularly Twitter's streaming API and BitCoin market data
        \item Researching novel ways to visualize and encode data for easy human consumption
        \item Conceiving and writing solutions that utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence
    \end{itemize}

                    This work in progress is an attempt to implement the Atari playing, deep learning AI from Deep Mind. Deep Thought uses computer vision to isolate game artifacts and 
                    sprites from the NES. The goal is to vastly reduce the size of the input layer that a naive implementation of DeepMind would require. 
                    This will improve both the speed of learning, and the quality of the final neural network.

                    A game description language (GDL) is a computer language that describes the rules of a game. 
                    This project was inspired by my interest in machine learning and AI. It has been spurred on by the 
                    Stanford general game playing MOOC. The ultimate goal is to explore the properties that make a game
                    fun for use in evaluation of new games produced using genetic programming techniques. 
                    The LeisurelyScript language draws heavily from the language 
                    outlined in Cameron Browne's "Automatic Generation and Evaluation".
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] LeisurelyScript uses Flex and Bison to generate the scanner and parser
                        \item[\textbullet] The compiler is used for the generation of a state machine expressed in C++
                        \item[\textbullet] The C++ state machine is then compiled into dll's using g++
                        \item[\textbullet] The state machine implements a standard API that an AI can query for required information

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item[\textbullet] Storm uses a graph like abstraction for representing the flow of data through various analyses
                        \item[\textbullet] Each node in Storm's graph is an algorithm, each directed edge represents input/output data flows
                        \item[\textbullet] Storm is language agnostic, nodes were written in Python due familiarity
                        \item[\textbullet] Collection code was written for Twitter, Mt. Gox, Btc-e, CoinBase, etc.
                        \item[\textbullet] A graph analysis tool was written for arbitrage analysis

                    I have completed an open source RepRap 3D printer. The printer started as a solo project, 
                    but since the completion of the initial build a team has been found to assist with further 
                    upgrades and research. I built the RepRap from scratch. I fabricated the structure, soldered  
                    the electronics, and flashed the firmware. 	The goals of this project are to advance the 
                    fields of robotic manufacturing and replication, to assist other projects at PSU, and to 
                    provide a teaching platform for students to learn more about rapid prototyping.
