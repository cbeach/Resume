\noindent  I have been interested in robotics for years.  My greatest project has been my RepRap (open source 3D printer).  
My RepRap was build from scratch, and currently resides in open tech space.  My newest project is an autonomous rover that
will be used as a test bed for the AVT's quad-rotor.  I will use the rover to develop several algorithms for autonomous 
navigation.  One of those algorithms will use photo OCR to navigate using signage.  This is a challenge for an autonomous
arial vehicle competion that the AVT will be competing in.

I am very interested in learning more about your company.  If you would like to know more about me please visit my github
