\noindent I have been interested in computer science for years.  During my exploration of computer science
I have had a wide variety of projects.  In addition to my curriculum I have spent a great deal of time
on personal projects that have increased my knowledge beyond what I acquired in school.

I am a very versatile individual and have projects - both completed and in progress - ranging from GPS trackers
3D printers, computer vision and the collection of "big data".

I am very interested in learning more about your company.  If you would like to know more about me please visit my github
repositories at the address below. \\
