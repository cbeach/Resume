\begin{flushleft} 
\noindent I heard about your company through Jen Hannin several months ago, and was excited to see that you were attending the 
PSU engineering career fair.


\noindent I have been interested in robotics for years.  During my exploration of robotics I've focused on 
the software side, but I have learned a great deal about electronics and electro-mechanical systems.  
My greatest project to date has been my scratch built RepRap (open source 3D printer), which currently resides in open 
tech space.

My newest project is an autonomous rover that will be used as a test bed for the autonomous vehicle team's (AVT)
quad-rotor.  I will use the rover to develop several algorithms for autonomous navigation.  One of those algorithms 
will use photo OCR to navigate using signage.  The application for this project is a challenge for an autonomous 
aerial vehicle competition that the AVT will be participating in.

I am very interested in learning more about your company.  If you would like to know more about me please visit my github
repositories at the address below. \\
